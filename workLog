we made a digital button connected to digital input 2 on the phat
now we want to take a picture in cam.py when button pressed 
or turn off the PI when button pressed for long. 
see lines 625ff in cam.py for most recent attempt. 

things to do next time: 
- what did pimoroni reply on the hackr email
- make hackr work
- make display work
- make button work
